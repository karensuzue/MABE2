# Main (working) build options:
#  native (default) - Optimized version of code. (38 sec)
#  debug - turn on all debugging options, including asserts and pointer tracking.  (37 sec)
#  quick - no debugging or optimization; fastest compile time. (21 sec)
#  clean - remove all compilation artifacts including executable.
#
# Other build options, more rarely used:
#  grumpy - Lots of extra warnings turned on
#  noblock - Same as native, but "blocking" debug code is still allowed.
